metaTitle: "Low Fidelity Prototype | WP"
metaDescription: "A prototype is a simulation of how a finished product will work. It allows product teams to test the usability and feasibility of their designs. Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts. Should not be so concrete."

## Why
The first and most important role of lo-fi prototypes is to check and test functionality rather than the visual appearance of the product
Inexpensive. The clear advantage of low-fidelity prototyping is its extremely low cost.
Fast. It’s possible to create a lo-fi paper prototype in just five to ten minutes. This allows product teams to explore different ideas without too much effort.
Collaborative. This type of prototyping stimulates group work. Since lo-fi prototyping doesn’t require special skills, more people can be involved in the design process. Even non-designers can play an active part in the idea-formulation process.
Clarifying. Both team members and stakeholders will have a much clearer expectation about an upcoming project
