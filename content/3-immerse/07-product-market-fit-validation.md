## Why
'The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit' - _Andreessen Horowitz_

If you want your business to succeed, you need to build products that your target customers really want.

“The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.” which is what we all want for our business.

## How

There are four stages of product market fit.

- Stage 1
  - Discover your customers and get their feedback about the product/service that you are going to produce.
- Stage 2
  - Test your product with the customers to make sure it really resonates with them
- Stage 3
  - The Customer Creation where you develop positioning and decide on your brand and product positioning.
- Stage 4
  - The Verification when you verify that what you’ve done so far, the customer feedback that you have, the positioning you’ve chosen and everything in between, is right.

### How to Measure?
