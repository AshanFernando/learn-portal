## Why
The product roadmap has several ultimate goals

- Describe the vision and strategy
- Provide a guiding document for executing the strategy
- Get internal stakeholders in alignment
- Facilitate discussion of options and scenario planning
- Help communicate with external stakeholders, including customers

## How
Product road maps evolve with the time. Based on which stage the project is, the focus can be changed in the road map.It is always best to create a road map at the start of each project and evolve it as the project grows. All product road maps will fall in to following three categories based on the different stages of the project.

- The no-dates road map
  - These are more flexible than road maps built on timelines. These are best for companies whose priorities changes constantly. This is best when the product is in early stages where information can change week by week
- The hybrid road map
  - This type is best when the product is more mature. In this type, there are dates, but no hard dates. The road map can be organized based on monthly or quarterly goals.
- The timeline road map
  - These type of road maps are not needed until the product reach maturity where there are multiple departments involved with dependencies to each other.

Tools that can be used to build road maps are listed below.
