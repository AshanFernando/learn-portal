## Why
Innovation project KPIs should be separated from the general business project KPIs to identify the business opportunities of unfamiliar environments. These KPIs should be defined and tailored to suit with each innovation project

## How

According to Dan Toma & Tendayi Viki (authors of The Corporate Startup) there exists 3 levels of KPIs.

- Reporting KPIs
  - Measure the progress of new ventures from ideation through to product-market fit

- Governance KPIs
  - Helps to identify whether or not to continue investing in particular ventures. 

- Global KPIs
  - Measure the overall progress of the innovation projects under the context of the larger business
