## Why
In this modern and rapid changing world it is important to base your decision on data. Collection and analysis of relevant and current data can be used to identify various market patterns. For instance you could find out what kind of financial benefits that your company has gained after a certain business decision. More importantly data analytics can reveal whether you have achieved the required ROI compared to the investments made. In other words this will help to spend on right things. Analyzing the right data can also give insights into various market patterns. It would be easy to spot what is trending in the market and you'll be able to make necessary adjustments ahead of your competition.

However, the most notable advantage of data analytic is the ability to do predictive modeling. Modern algorithms are capable of predicting where the market and user patterns are likely to head. This can easily make your organization more proactive. 


## How
Consider the following when thinking of building an analytics suite.

- Start early in the life cycle
It is important to keep the analytics aspect of data from the very beginning of the product life cycle. Data needs to be modeled very differently to your normal transaction processing application. Consider building a dimension or a Kimball model which is independent yet connected to your main relational data model. 

- Data driven API endpoints
It is also important to consider building data driven APIs rather than functionality driven APIs.
In other words make sure that your end points are engineered to return raw data in universally accepted formats (Eg:- OData) and use the client side to process data. This in contrast to returning processed data will make it easier later on to build data analytics applications.

- Data visualization
There are many tried and tested off the shelf applications available for data visualization and predictive modeling. As long as your data is universally acceptable and accessible via above mentioned end points, you'll be able to fit these applications right into your product.

- Decision making
The real success of this only comes when you include the output of data analytics in your business decisions. Therefore, do the needed alteration in your decision making process to reflect this information.

- Continuously improve
Analytics is based on learning algorithms. More learning your algorithms have, it will be better at predicting accurate outcomes. So you are unlikely to gain the benefit of analytics at the very beginning. Have patients, trust the algorithm and it will reward you eventually.
