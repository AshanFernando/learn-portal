## Why
The main objective in this strategic action is to reduce operational cost. Reducing the bottom line directly translates into more profits and at this stage in the product development life cycle it makes sense to focus even more on profits.

Re looking at business processes also means that you focus on stabilizing the product. It's natural to think of more long term solutions at this stage. You might have been spending on unnecessary things up to now as the previous stages were more rapid. You might have made some cost decisions without all needed information before. 


## How
Consider the following when thinking of optimizing the cost structure.

- Actioning the user feedback
Listen to product users, find out what users are willing to pay for. And for unpopular features consider downsizing them or removing them all together to reduce operational and maintenance cost. 

- R&D budget
You might have spent a lot of money during earlier plan and build stages on infrastructure and resources. As for resources, re-look at the workload, if its on a downwards trajectory then consider shredding some resources to save cost. On the other hand, have a look at the spending on infrastructure as well. You might have made some unnecessary infrastructure decisions based on assumptions. However, the experience from earlier stages will help to eliminate these unnecessary waste now.

- Follow best practices
This could also be a good stage to do research on best practices that the world follows in development, quality assurance, UX and marketing activities. Spend a bit more time to learn from others especially if you did not have the time earlier.

- Data driven cost decision
Use data to make decisions about cost reduction. Use data to find waste and avoid cutting costs on ares where it hurts.
