Yearly, a large number of global ISVs and Startups are investing on digital services to be provided to their customers. SaaS market itself is forecasted to jump beyond 100 B USD by 2025 with around 16% CAGR. 

## ISV Challenges
Despite the lucrative trend, a major portion of the Software Products that are released into the market fail to reach the full potential and fair to reap ROI due to fundamental issues in the product management and engineering approach. 

Creating a market leading (winning) product requires a mammoth of additional knowledge and skills compared to mere software development. Product engineers require a broader sense of the domain, market trends, product management techniques, customer engagement ability, resilient engineering capabilities, etc. Most of such skills are not taught at universities nor gained by engaging general software development work.
