It is important to recognize that software product management is a specialty and significantly differs from enterprise or bespoke applications development.


## Market Activities
Bespoke applications are custom made for a particular context and has no complexities of sales, marketing and competition. But, this is a major focal point for product teams.

Every product must have a unique selling point (USP) against the competition. The success of the product depends on how well all the teams (dev, support,sales and marketing) are aligned to improve the USP. 


## Onboarding and Licensing
Product must be seamlessly accessible by potential customers through integrated capabilities such as self-sign-up, trials, documentary, online payments.etc. The core product has to be engineered to support customer onboarding in a frictionless manner.

Most mature products provide different product variations (editions) to address distinctive market segments. Such editions may be formed with a mix-n-match of features through a license based commercial mechanism. The features such as ability to trace billing, throttling based on usage, etc. makes product engineering and operation vastly different from bespoke development.

## Architectural Agility

Unlike enterprise applications, products require to adapt and respond to changing market conditions to stay ahead of the competition. Such frequent changes are often costly in development, and impact number of customers using your product. Therefore the agility at the architecture level is paramount important for sustaining your product's market leadership. Such agility is gained by thoughtful decoupling and continuous architecting practices that are detailed in the [Winning Product Learning Portal](https://learn.winningproduct.com/).


## Functional Flexibility

Products are not used by a single organization/user but are sold to multiple clients. Business rules, process workflows, integration requirements, etc. may substantially differ from one organization to another. Product teams has to deal with a lot of unknowns and therefore the product must be configurable and broadly compatible. 

For example, the underline domain model needs to be generic and flexible to accommodate workflow differences in organizations. In another example, the product may require a flexible integration layer that can support multiple protocols to suite the different scenarios of different customer organizations.


## User Experience

The importance of ‘user experience’ is far more prominent in product engineering for two reasons.  
- Firstly, the obvious market competition factor. 
- Secondly for the fact that products are not made for a particular known organizational user base but should cater diverse (and mostly unknown) user groups of multiple customer organizations. 

This is a nontrivial challenge that requires research into personas and user-journeys. Product teams treat requirements as assumptions and validate/invalidate them through a series of steps.

## Branding and Identity

Specially in B2B domain, branding cannot be made fixed. Different clients should be able to brand the product according to their corporate theme and branding guidelines including logos, colors, etc.

To make things further complicated, in certain business models, the product may get sold as a plugin through partner channels. Such arrangement makes the ISV an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) where the product should have the capabilities of white-labelling.

## ROI Expectations

RoI is usually immediate as in a custom deployed bespoke application. In contrast, products take longer time to return financial benefits as it may take time to establish in the market. Until such time the product must stay trendy and relevant and be competitive. Such requires sophistication in engineering practices such as automation, delivery, quality controls, etc. Apart from that a higher degree of maintainability with a sustainable cost of operation is essential.
