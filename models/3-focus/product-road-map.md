There are many definitions that exists product roadmaps. Some can simply say that "it is a statement of intent" which others can reply on a more elaborate definition such as "A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering over time. A product roadmap communicates the why and what behind what you’re building. It’s a guiding strategic document as well as a plan for executing the strategy."[1].

Looking at it simply, it is a way to communicate to the stakeholders what is intended to be done in the project, the direction and how long it will take to complete the items. This helps different stakeholders take different decisions. The business side of the company can allocate budget and make business deals based on this while the developers involved can identify what are the prioritized items and identify which items needs to be done next and when.

There is no well defined way accepted globally to create a roadmap. It depends on the personal preferences and company culture. Even thought when working on agile, the role of time based planning is downplayed, majority of the roadmaps as based on some sort of representation of time. Whether it is a fixed time line or some sort of indication of how long it will take to complete an item.[3]

There can be many roadmaps tailored to different audiences. A roadmap prepared for executives may not need granular details that are needed for a roadmap prepared for developers. [1]

The product roadmap has several ultimate goals: [1]

-Describe the vision and strategy

-Provide a guiding document for executing the strategy

-Get internal stakeholders in alignment

-Facilitate discussion of options and scenario planning

-Help communicate to external stakeholders, including customers

Product roampas envolve with the time. Based on which stage the project is, the focus can be changed in the roadmap.It is always best to create a roadmap at the start of each project and evolve it as the project grows. All product roadmaps will fall in to following three categories based on the different stages of the project.

1. The no-dates roadmap

These are more flexible than roadmaps bult on timelines. These are best for companies whose priorities changes constantly. This is best when the product is in early stages where information can change week by week. [1]

2. The hybrid roadmap

This type is best when the product is more mature. In this type, there are dates, but no hard dates. The roapmap can be organized based on monthly or quarterly goals.

3. The timeline roadmap [3]

These type of roadmaps are not needed until the product reach maturity where there are multiple departments involved with dependencies to each other.
