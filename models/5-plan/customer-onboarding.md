## Why

This is the process of helping new customers get started and stay engaged. It’s a series of steps and resources that help make incorporating a product into the user’s routine as easy as possible. 

It should be noted that customers expect world-class onboarding experience from products and services they use today. All your marketing and sales work has a little use if your onboarding process and customer journey is not smooth and pleasurable. 

## How

Onboarding process starts when the Sales Process is over. Usually this stage is handled by 'Customer Success' team.

The onboarding process may differ for different type of products. Mainly there are 2 types of product onboarding we see in the market.

1. SaaS self subscription (B2C, Utility products)
2. Touch-and-feel onboarding (B2B, Enterprise products)

It is important that user journeys of customer onboarding is documented and validated across different modules of the product (demo, trials, website, data import, licencing, payment, etc.) as well as across different departments (marketing, sales, customer success, implementation, support, etc)

### Type of activities

Based on the type of onboarding your product require, the activities may differ. Some of the common activities of this stage are:
 - Welcome artifacts (emails, videos, brochures)
 - Product registration (Forms, SSO)
 - Tutorials (Videos, in product tours, step-by-step guides, tips)
 - Quick setup (default settings)
 - Data import (Basic data, Seamless migration, integrations)
 - Sends consistent reminders and motivators
 - Feedback collection (followup calls, emails, surveys, stickiness data)
 - Continuous reviews of the collected data to improve the customer onboarding process

The goal of these activities is to support the customer to have their 'first win' ('aha' moment) by use of our product. The process to get to this must be pleasurable and personalized for the customer to build loyalty towards the product.

### How to measure the success?
There are objective and subjective ways to measure the quality of your customer onboarding process.
 - Data collected through surveys, interviews, feedback (subjective)
 - Monitor and measure customer engagement
   - How often customers come back
   - How long do they stay
   - How many features they explore
   - How many wins they get by using the features
