## Why

Delivering innovations better than competitors is one of the main objectives of a winning product. Establishing the product intellectual rights and protecting it to keep the competitive advantage is important to survive and thrive in the market. In addition, the team must ensure that the product wouldn't violate the IP rights of any other party to avoid any legal complication. 

Apart from this, innovation and IPR plays a significant role in taking the product to market. Trademarks, copyrights, industrial designs, patents, trade secrets etc. are important for the customers to establish trust and distinguish the product from similar products.

## How
- Establish product licencing 
  - Licensing is the fundamental means of granting third parties to use the product intellectual property. 
  - Most Proprietary licensing is connected to a financial commitment and is time bound.
  - Document and validate all the third party components and libraries used by the product to assure compatibility of the license of the product.
  - Implement a approval process for introducing any new third party component and library
- Identify IP artifacts and formulate a plan to protect them. There are several common approaches for this.
  - Sign software licensing agreements 
  - Copyrights notices: Such may protect the code, user guides and the graphical elements like icons
  - Trade marks: Essential way to protect and establish the identity in the market
  - Patents: Protect the technical effects of the product. Complicated and costly process.
  - Industrial Design: This can protect graphical user interfaces from copying
  - Trade secrets: This require extensive measures to safeguard trade secrets by limiting access to knowledge
  - Database rights: Output of a process can be protected through this.
