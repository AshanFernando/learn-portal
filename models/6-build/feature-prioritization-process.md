##Why
If we do not select proper features in the planning stage, which need to be in the end product, it takes forever to deliver even an MVP(Minimum Viable Product). And sometimes, valuable time of teams are wasted developing features that no one needs. This can be catastrophic for businesses with limited time and budget, and especially for startups

##How

There are numerous ways to do feature prioritization and there are pros and cons to each technique as well. We will not be exploring every method in this context, as it defies the purpose of this learning material. Instead, an overview of these methods is explained below.
