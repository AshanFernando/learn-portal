##Why

Businesses are nowadays adopting DevOps and Cloud Computing. DevOps makes the team agile as well as focuses on delivering value and changing the dynamics of development, operation, and quality assurance teams. Cloud computing has changed software in service. To increase the effectiveness of DevOps adoption requires the knowledge of Automation Testing. Automation testing is the management and performance of test activities, to include the development and execution of test scripts so as to verify test requirements, using an automation testing tool. It helps in the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Thus, automation testing has become an indispensable part of quality assurance. Automation testing helps team reduce human error during repetitive testing. In a world where continuous release and testing is increasingly becoming the norm, it is vital that the test activities must be performed accurately and efficiently. Automation testing also reduces time consumption of testing, as it is faster than human testing and an execution can be triggered multiple times immediately one after another and sometimes in parallel. 

##How

Benefits of automation testing can be reaped at maximum if following points are considered when building up the automation framework:
 - Decide what Test Cases to Automate
 - Test Early and Test Often
 - Select the Right Automated Testing Tool
 - Divide your Automated Testing Efforts
 - Create Good, Quality Test Data
 - Create Automated Tests that are Resistant to Changes in the UI
 
In addition to that, it is also recommended to focus on the following pointers when choosing which test cases to automate.
 - Repetitive tests that run for multiple builds.
 - Tests that tend to cause human error.
 - Tests that require multiple data sets.
 - Frequently used functionality that introduces high risk conditions.
 - Tests that are impossible to perform manually.
 - Tests that run on several different hardware or software platforms and configurations.
 - Tests that take a lot of effort and time when manual testing.
 
The ultimate objective of the automation testing is to verify that the business scenarios are not broken from the new release. With this, the agile team can deploy as many releases as required to meet the business requirments which is dynamic in nature.
