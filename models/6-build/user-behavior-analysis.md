## why
User behavior analytics (UBA) is the tracking and assessing of how users use the systems and data using automated monitoring systems. This is important to understand:
  - What features your users are mostly interested and caring
  - Where do they get stuck and having troubles with
  - What sections are performing better in delivering value to users
  - What sections are ignored by users, can be removed, pivoted to keep the product simple and efficient
  - Detect abnormal user behaviors such as heavy usage, unauthorized access, data tampering, etc.

When you have UBA in your product you no longer have to guess or take decisions based on opinions. Your decisions on product roadmap becomes objective and data driven.

## how

- Understand the type of tools that can be employed to track user behavior. There are multiple tool types such as:
  - User activity heat maps
  - Funnel views of user journey
  - Statistical information of user events
  - Session recordings
  - Security triggers and alarms
- Document the type of actionable insights that must be derived from the tools and do the tool integration accordingly.
- Keep user users informed of the type of data collected and obtain concent as required to avoid privacy violations
- Set up a visualization dashboard and reports for easy interpretation of the insights
- Set up a routine process to review and take actions based on the collected data
